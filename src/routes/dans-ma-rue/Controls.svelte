<div class="h5 w-100 pa1 flex items-stretch">
  // TODO query rendered features and display a line chart here with the number
  of claims and a pie chart with the proportion of each type. The pie chart has
  a legend that serves as filters (along with a select all and deselect all
  buttons?). We'll probably want a "normalize" button to see the proportion of
  claims of each type through time. If we have a "play" mode we'll want sparkles
  like in escapades :)
